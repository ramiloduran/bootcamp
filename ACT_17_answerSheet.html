    <h1>The Importance of Italian Cuisine</h1>
    <p>Italian cuisine (Italian: Cucina italiana) is a Mediterranean cuisine consisting of the ingredients, recipes and
        cooking techniques developed across the Italian Peninsula since antiquity, and later spread around the world
        together with waves of Italian diaspora. Significant changes occurred with the colonization of the Americas and
        the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, capsicums, maize and sugar beet â€” the latter introduced in quantity in
        the 18th century. It is one of the best-known and most appreciated gastronomies worldwide.</p>
    <h2>Spaghetti</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti (is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta">pasta</a>. It is a
        staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like
        other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals.
        Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum wheat semolina. Usually the pasta is white because refined flour
        is used, but whole wheat flour may be added. Spaghettoni is a thicker form of spaghetti, while capellini is a
        very thin spaghetti.</p>

    <h1>Spiders</h1>
    <p>Snakes are some of the most feared animals, up there with spiders and centipedes for many. Some people even
        suffer from ophidiophobia, an intense fear of snakes. This fear is not unfounded. Our bodies have evolved to
        fear animals that could potentially harm us, and some snakes certainly can be deadly.</p>
